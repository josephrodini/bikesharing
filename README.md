# Citibike Project: From NYC to Des Moines

Using Tableau to visualize bike sharing data

## Overview of analysis

This project is intended to help Kate pitch a potential business idea to an angel investor. Based on the success of the Citibike operation in New York City, this proposed business would instead take place in Des Moines, Iowa. A datafile of bike trip information from August 2019 was obtained and is the source of the analyses. 

### Deliverables

- An .ipynb file that changes the trip duration column's datatype from integer to datetime.
- A Tableau story consisting of at least seven visualizations of the NYC Citibike datafile.
- This README explaining the analysis

### Resources

- Files: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
- Technology: Tableau, Python, Jupyter Notebook

## Results

### Deliverable One

In order to create visualizations that can accurately display trip durations, the trip duration column of the data file was converted from integer datatype to datetime datatype. This was done in a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file. The csv file was loaded as a Pandas dataframe, the column converted, and the dataframe exported as a new csv file.

### Deliverable Two

In order to sway the potential angel investor, a number of visualizations were created to illistrate the success of New York City's bike share program. In the order they are presented in the Tableau story:
