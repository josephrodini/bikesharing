# Citibike Project: From NYC to Des Moines

Using Tableau to visualize bike sharing data

## Overview of analysis

This project is intended to help Kate pitch a potential business idea to an angel investor. Based on the success of the Citibike operation in New York City, this proposed business would instead take place in Des Moines, Iowa. A datafile of bike trip information from August 2019 was obtained and is the source of the analyses. 

### Deliverables

- An .ipynb file that changes the trip duration column's datatype from integer to datetime.
- A Tableau story consisting of at least seven visualizations of the NYC Citibike datafile.
- This README explaining the analysis

### Resources

- Files: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
- Technology: Tableau, Python, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
